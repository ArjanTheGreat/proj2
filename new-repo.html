<h1>Setting up Project 2 from scratch</h1>
<p>If you have unsolvable problems with your git repo, the easiest thing to do is to clone a new copy from github. You can then work with that instead and ignore the one you set up before. Here are the steps. You might want to copy-paste them to avoid typos.

<pre style="font-size: large">
$ cd ~
$ git clone git@github.com:ucberkeley-cs61c/<span style="color:red">cs61c-<b>XX</b></span>.git <span style="color:blue">NAME_OF_YOUR_NEW_REPO</span>
$ cd <span style="color:blue">NAME_OF_YOUR_NEW_REPO</span>
<del>$ test -d proj2 &amp;&amp; rm -rf proj2 &amp;&amp; git add -u &amp;&amp; git commit -m "clean up broken files"</del> Don't do this unless your proj2 folder shows up as a folder with a green arrow on github.
$ git remote add proj2 git://github.com/ucberkeley-cs61c/proj2.git
$ git pull proj2 master
</pre>

That's it! Your new git repository should now be in the directory name you chose, and the project 2 files in the "proj2" subdirectory of that.
